# Job Shop Scheduling Problem solved using bio-inspired artifical intelligence methods

In this project for the coures IT3708, I created a Particle Swarm Optimization-algorithm and an Ant Colony Optimization-algorithm in order to schedule different jobs on different machines to reduce makespan. 

I scored a 10.5/15.0 on the project.
